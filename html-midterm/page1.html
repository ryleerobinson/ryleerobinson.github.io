<h3>EDGAR ALLAN POE WATCHES TOO MUCH TikTok</h3><br>
<h2>by JAMIE CRICKS</h2><br>
 
<p>Once upon a midday dreary, while I scrolled on, bummed and teary,<br>
Over many a short and spurious video of current cultural lore—<br>
While I blinked on, nearly napping, suddenly there came a trapping,<br>
In the form of someone boldly capping, capping on my #fyp tour.<br>
“’Tis some new #tiktoker,” I muttered, “capping on my #fyp tour—<br>
Only this, and nothing more.”</p>

<p>Oh, bestie I can say it was not the brightest and shiniest day,<br>
And I drew my curtains all the way, my own writings seemed a chore.<br>
Desperately I watched with sorrow;—procrastinating till the morrow<br>
All the trends they borrow—borrow for their follower core—<br>
Imploring viewers with overstuffed closets full of things they never wore—<br>
To shop their Amazon store.</p>

<p>And living rent-free in my head were the skits that left me dead—<br>
Sending me, with POVs and with spilled teas never heard before;<br>
So that now, as I sat wiping on my throne, I kept on swiping.<br>
Now a lumberjack with nip nops out diligently worked his core—<br>
Then a sneaky link pick-me girl stood attacking an enlarged pore;—<br>
Lip-syncing her contour.</p>

<p>And scrolling fast past a big yikes to a repost just wanting more likes—<br>
Boring duets that didn’t understand the assignment for sure;<br>
I almost stopped and started working, but a real one on the floor twerking,<br>
Made me pause and reconsider—I stan a dancing queen who’s mature.<br>
Plus TBH, it’s the spicy eggplants and snatched waists I am mostly here for;—<br>
Seggs sells, forever more.</p>

<p>Presently my boredom grew stronger; I could procrastinate no longer,<br>
“Self,” said I, “you must stop, truly what are you wasting your life for;”<br>
But the fact is I kept scrolling—and so many trolls were trolling,<br>
The ASMR so lulling, it had me laid out on the floor.<br>
Teeth crunching into ice and berries—over iced fizzy drinks pour,<br>
Allowing me to restore.</p>

<p>Deep into my phone screen peering, long I sat there laughing, tearing,<br>
Staring, watching things no cheugy had any business being there for;<br>
But my vibe remained unchecked—and my day was already wrecked—<br>
So the only word I said was the whispered word, “Anymore?”<br>
As I whispered, a tarot reader with no hashtags replied, “There’s more!”—<br>
Just manifest for sure.<p>

<p>On my back in my room laying—a girl-boss gatekeeper intent on slaying—<br>
Asked me to get ready with her from her closet door,<br>
“Surely,” said I, “surely there is some vid that will show me a snack:<br>
A fit of hunger soon to attack, and this refrigerator to explore”—<br>
Then a Doritos covered in <em> crème fraiche </em> and caviar appeared;—<br>
“But alas, I am too poor.”</p>

<p>Though a casserole looked appealing trying my stomach’s empty feeling—<br>
The aggravated reaction of a chef made me ignore;<br>
“Those hot Cheetos: exciting, but that unseasoned chicken: not inviting,<br>
And all this pink sauce fighting has me shook down to my core—<br>
Tell me what would be bussin and what snack should I be sussin!”<br>
But the big boy did ignore.</p>

<p>I soon gave up this pursuit to watch a therapist who seemed astute,<br>
Though her guidance held some meaning—no real revelation bore;<br>
But I could not help agreeing that no narcissistic being<br>
Should be allowed to keep bread-crumbing and gaslighting heretofore—<br>
Recognizing my trauma responses I swore,<br>
“I need therapy galore!”</p>

<p>Much I marveled at amazing talents whose dancing was fire-blazing,<br>
They did the box, the cannibal, the tap in—and oh so many more,<br>
And the people were agreeing that they are talented human beings—<br>
And everyone ran to the comments, which either passed the vibe check or—<br>
They would argue who was better and who should not post anymore.<br>
As though keeping score.</p>

<p>Then came the sweet antic of a Jack Russell acting frantic,<br>
And a cat who couldn’t be found but was hiding in a drawer;<br>
Alas with sweet and tender tones, a tribute to a Noodle with no bones—<br>
Bringing me to sadness with nostalgia so I shed a tear or four—<br>
But then a darling raccoon stole a dogs treat to even up the score!<br>
And someone taught their parrot to call everyone a whore!<br>
Only that and nothing more.</p>

<p>Now upon a midnight dreary, I still scrolled, though a bit more cheery,<br>
Over many a quick and entertaining video of an emu, hippo, and boar—<br>
While I dozed off, phone screen glowing, there came along an idea growing,<br>
As of some poem gently flowing to explore—<br>
“’Tis about a raven,” I muttered. “The hours seem wasted no more!”<br>
A win is a win, and TikTok I adore.</p>
